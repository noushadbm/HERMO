# HERMO - Backend
Rest API developed using java and spring-boot, for supporting frond-end applications.

Note: As of now it uses in memory H2 db with file storage for persistence.
So configuration 'spring.datasource.url' in src/main/resource/application.properties need to be updated based on your environment.
